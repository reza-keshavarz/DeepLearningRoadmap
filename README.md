# Deep Learning Roadmap

Here is a list of high quality resources for anyone intending to dive into deep learning world. The list consists of different types of material including textbooks, video courses, and blog posts. Some of theme may overlap, but it doesn't hurt to read something you already know from the perspective of another expert.

**It is presumed that you already know what machine learning is, what are its types (supervised, unsupervised), and what problems it aims to some (i.e. classification, regression, etc.)**
[or maybe add some intro to ml courses too]


strucure:
three parts, in each part divide into video, book, posts


-- parts: 1. pre-requisites, 2. start deep learning, 3. become a master in one field

-- make it two parts: first genreral/beginner
-- then for mid-level and advanced for each Specific topic


## Part one: pre-requisites
To tackle deep learning, you must at least be familiar with the following:
  * programming
  * basic mathematics and statistics (high school level)
  * machine learning
Although this list aims to go in depth for deep learning, I have gathered a small list of resources for these three pre-requisites.

### Programming
* [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)  
  In contrast to its own name, this book teaches python in a straight and to the point way.


### Math
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)  
  This specialization covers the basics of mathematics needed in deep learning, including linear algebra and multivariate calculus.  


* [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781492072935/)  
  This O'Reilly book covers some useful concepts in statistics and probability, and their implementation in both R and Python programming languages.  



### Machine learning
* [Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)  
  This book covers different aspects of working with data, including visualization and modeling. What makes it different from the rest is that it tries to avoid pre-written tools and aims to expose the reader to the underlying concepts first. This gives the reader a deeper understanding of data science which will become handy when things get harder :)  


* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition \(First part only)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)    
This is probably the most famous book for machine learning, and for good reason. It both covers the theory and practical aspects of the game. It consists of two parts: the first covers classic machine learning and the second half is focused on deep learning. The first half is the only part you must undergo before starting your deep learning journey.



## Part two: deep learning basics

## Part three: we need to get deeper
