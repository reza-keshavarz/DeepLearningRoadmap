# Deep Learning Roadmap

Here is a list of high quality resources for anyone intending to dive into deep learning world. The list consists of different types of material including textbooks, video courses, and blog posts. Some of theme may overlap, but it doesn't hurt to read something you already know from the perspective of another expert.

**It is presumed that you already know what machine learning is, what are its types (supervised, unsupervised), and what problems it aims to some (i.e. classification, regression, etc.)**
